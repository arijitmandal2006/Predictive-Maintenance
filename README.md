# Predictive-Maintenance
This project monitors machine health in real time using temperature, vibration (MPU6050), and sound (microphone) sensors. It employs TinyML (Edge Impulse/TensorFlow Lite) for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance alerts (e.g., lubrication needed, overload, or normal operation). Includes:
